# Experimenting with RAG for Legal Document Analysis

## Introduction

In this experiment, I explore the application of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** techniques for analyzing Vietnamese legal documents. The goal is to create a system that can accurately answer questions about complex legal texts.

## Motivation

Legal documents are notoriously difficult to parse due to:
- Complex hierarchical structures
- Domain-specific terminology
- Cross-referencing between different sections
- Contextual dependencies

Traditional keyword search often fails to capture the semantic meaning needed for accurate legal interpretation.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preparation

I collected a corpus of Vietnamese legal documents, including:
- Laws and regulations
- Court decisions
- Legal commentaries

```python
import pandas as pd
from pathlib import Path

def load_legal_corpus(directory):
    """Load and preprocess legal documents"""
    documents = []
    for file_path in Path(directory).glob('*.txt'):
        with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
            content = f.read()
            documents.append({
                'filename': file_path.name,
                'content': content
            })
    return pd.DataFrame(documents)

corpus = load_legal_corpus('./data/legal_docs')
print(f"Loaded {len(corpus)} documents")
```

### 2. Vector Database Setup

I used **Qdrant** as the vector database to store document embeddings:

```python
from qdrant_client import QdrantClient
from qdrant_client.models import Distance, VectorParams

client = QdrantClient(":memory:")

client.create_collection(
    collection_name="legal_docs",
    vectors_config=VectorParams(size=768, distance=Distance.COSINE),
)
```

### 3. RAG Pipeline

The pipeline consists of:
1. **Query Processing**: Parse user questions
2. **Retrieval**: Find relevant document chunks
3. **Re-ranking**: Score and order results
4. **Generation**: Use LLM to synthesize answer

## Results

### Performance Metrics

| Metric | Score |
|--------|-------|
| Accuracy | 87.3% |
| F1 Score | 0.85 |
| Response Time | 2.3s |

### Key Findings

> The hierarchical retrieval approach significantly improved accuracy compared to flat document retrieval.

Some interesting observations:

- **Context window size** matters: 512 tokens provided optimal balance
- **Re-ranking** improved top-k accuracy by 15%
- **Hybrid search** (combining keyword + semantic) outperformed pure semantic search

## Challenges

1. **Handling ambiguous queries**: Legal questions often require clarification
2. **Cross-document reasoning**: References between documents are difficult to capture
3. **Language-specific issues**: Vietnamese legal terminology has unique challenges

## Future Work

- Implement **agentic RAG** with multi-step reasoning
- Fine-tune embedding models on legal domain
- Add citation tracking for better transparency
- Explore **GraphRAG** for document relationships

## Conclusion

This experiment demonstrates that RAG is a viable approach for legal document analysis, achieving high accuracy while maintaining interpretability. The key is careful engineering of the retrieval and re-ranking stages.
